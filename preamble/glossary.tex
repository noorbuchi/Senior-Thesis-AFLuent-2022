Spectrum Based Fault Localization & The automated approach to rank statements
based on a measure of how suspicious they are of being faulty.\\
Suspiciousness Score & A numerical score that indicates the likelihood of a
statement being faulty.\\
Pytest & An extendable Python tool for automated tests.\\
Per-test Coverage & The lines of code under test executed by each test case.\\
Mutant Density & The number of possible mutants that could be added to a statement.\\
Random Tie Breaking & The randomization of ranks between tied statements with
the same suspiciousness scores.\\
Cyclomatic Tie Breaking & The reliance on the cyclomatic complexity score of a
function to resolved ties between ranked statements.\\
Logical Tie Breaking & A metric used to break ties by measuring the mutant
density of a statement.\\
Enhanced Tie Breaking & A holistic metric used to break ranking ties by
including mutant density of a statement and its parent nodes.\\
\emph{EXAM} Score & The percentage of results that a developer must parse before
finding the correct location of the fault.\\
