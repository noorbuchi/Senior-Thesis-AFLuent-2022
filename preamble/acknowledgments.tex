Many thanks to Dr. Kapfhammer for his invaluable assistance in the development of this
idea, the implementation, and evaluation of this tool. His continuos advice
and encouragement throughout the research was crucial in pointing me in the
right direction. I'm grateful for the time and effort he dedicated to ensure the
completion of this project. I'm also thankful for the Allegheny College
Computer Science faculty and my classmates for all their support and willingness
