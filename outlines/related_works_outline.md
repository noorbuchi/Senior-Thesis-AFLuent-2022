**Related Works Outline**

# Outline

## Literature Review

- These initial sources will be extensively discussed while working on adding
  more sources for the research.

- [Evaluation of Tarantula AFL technique](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1101908.1101949)
  - Used as basis for implementing the algorithm and ensuring accuracy
  - Could be used to create similar evaluation strategies for the implementation
- [Expectations on Automate Fault Localization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2931037.2931051)
  - Survey paper that discusses what developers are looking for in AFL techniques
  - Can be used to address shortcomings of current implementation in AFL tools
- [An Evaluation of Similarity Coefficients for Software Fault Localization](../Papers%20PDFs/An%20Evaluation%20of%20Similarity%20Coefficients%20for%20Software%20Fault%20Localization.pdf)
  - A somewhat old paper. However, could be used in exploring different AFL techniques
- [Zoltar: A toolset for automatic fault localization](../Papers%20PDFs/Zoltar:%20A%20toolset%20for%20automatic%20fault%20localization.pdf)
  - Presents a working AFL toolset
  - Could be used as inspiration to the new planned tool
- [A Survey on Software Fault Localization](../Papers%20PDFs/survey%20on%20software%20fault%20localiation.pdf)
  - Contains a list of important sources that can be used
  - Explores the wide range of literature around AFL
- [PABLO: Helping Novices Debug Python Code Through Data-Driven Fault Localization](../Papers%20PDFs/Helping%20Novices%20Debug%20Python%20Code.pdf)
  - Discusses more frequent types of errors that novice programmers face when
    programming in Python
  - Helps in deciding what types of errors to detect when developing the tool
